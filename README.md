I am a [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) team member, machine learning researcher working on [neural-structured-learning](https://github.com/tensorflow/neural-structured-learning) and machine learning Ph.D candidate in UCSD's [NoiseLab](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/).  My work revolves around the Open Source community, Computer Vision, and bringing effective software engineering practices to ML.

My current focuses are:
- [KerasCV](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv), a set of computer vision extensions for Keras
- a research project focused on robust image represenetation (paper coming soon)
- coursework at UCSD
- implementing and reviewing [keras.io](https://keras.io) examples
- publishing useful ML content on [lukewood.xyz](https://lukewood.xyz)
- eventually making time to finish [WizardWars.online](https://wizardwars.online)

I've also contributed to the following open source projects:

[keras-team/keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras), [tensorflow/neural-structured-learning](https://github.com/tensorflow/neural-structured-learning), [tensorflow/tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow), [keras-team/keras-io](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io), [mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized](https://github.com/mozilla/eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized), [openai/gym](https://github.com/openai/gym), [werner-duvaud/muzero-general](https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general), [8000net/LectureNotesMaster](https://github.com/8000net/LectureNotesMaster), [eclipse-theia/theia](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia), [mapeditor/tiled](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled), [pixijs/pixi-particles](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-particles), [ImageStyle/ImStyle](https://github.com/ImageStyle/ImStyle), [googleforgames/agones](https://github.com/googleforgames/agones), [michalochman/react-pixi-fiber](https://github.com/michalochman/react-pixi-fiber), [kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime), [insin/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode](https://github.com/insin/gatsby-plugin-dark-mode), [halftheopposite/TOSIOS](https://github.com/halftheopposite/TOSIOS), [golang/vscode-go](https://github.com/golang/vscode-go), [pmndrs/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), [jiupinjia/SkyAR](https://github.com/jiupinjia/SkyAR), [jointheleague/DragonCoin](https://github.com/jointheleague/DragonCoin)

My other passions include reinforcement learning, surfing, generative modeling, and free diving.
