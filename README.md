# Hello, I'm Luke!

I am a [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) team member, machine learning researcher working on [neural-structured-learning](https://github.com/tensorflow/neural-structured-learning) and machine learning Ph.D candidate in UCSD's [NoiseLab](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu/).  My primary focus area is Computer Vision.  

My current focuses are:
- [KerasCV](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv), a set of computer vision extensions for Keras
- a research project focused on robust image represenetation (paper coming soon...)
- coursework at UCSD
- implementing and reviewing [keras.io](https://keras.io) examples
- publishing useful ML content on [lukewood.xyz](https://lukewood.xyz)

My other passions include reinforcement learning, open source, surfing, and diving.

I've also contributed to the following open source projects:
